It is typically a short cylindrical device with a protruding pointed tip (straight or angled) and which is secured to the distal end of a long, thin, flexible rod/shaft having a handle at the proximal end. It is pressed down the intramedullary canal to the fracture site and the surgeon manipulates the alignment, reducing the bone fragments under image-intensifier control. It is made of high-grade stainless steel. This is a reusable device."
842188114670,Bone awl,"A spike-like, orthopaedic, surgical instrument that is used to bore holes in bone. It is typically designed as a straight or slightly curve rod-like instrument with a sharp, trocar-like point at the distal end and a T-shaped handle at the proximal end. It is manually-operated by the surgeon who rotates the point back and forth on the bone whilst exerting pressure onto the handle. This operation will penetrate the hard outer bone and create a passage into, e.g., a medullary canal. It is typically made of high-grade stainless steel, titanium (Ti) and a synthetic material for the handle (e.g., Tufnol). This is a reusable device intended to be sterilized prior to use."

842188110009,Orthopaedic bone-reduction tool,"A hand-held manual surgical instrument that is fed down the intramedullary canal of a long bone (e.g., the femur) to help reposition a fracture where the two sections are out of alignment to achieve reduction for consequent reaming and nailing of the bone. It is typically a short cylindrical device with a protruding pointed tip (straight or angled) and which is secured to the distal end of a long, thin, flexible rod/shaft having a handle at the proximal end. It is pressed down the intramedullary canal to the fracture site and the surgeon manipulates the alignment, reducing the bone fragments under image-intensifier control. It is made of high-grade stainless steel. This is a reusable device."
842188109997,Bone holding forceps,"A manual surgical instrument designed to grasp and hold a bone during an open surgical procedure. It is typically strongly constructed with a scissors-like design, which may or may not be self-retaining, and with ring handles or curved shank handles. It is made of high-grade stainless steel and is available in various sizes. The working end can have a wide variety of jaws designs, e.g., curved serrated jaws, straight toothed jaws, or profiled wrench-like jaws with grooves to provide extra grip of the bone. This is a reusable device."

It is made of metal [e.g., stainless steel, cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr)], and may be malleable or rigid; some types include a nut designed to be attached to the wire to prevent wire migration. This is a single-use device."
